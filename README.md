## 1. Introduction

Here I am planning to collect notes on performance optimizations of machine learning models<br>

I will start with CNNs, but am planning to consider also RNNs/LSTMs on one side, and "classical" models and approaches, like RandomForest, XGBoost, etc. on the other side.  

Besides _accuracy_, the performance characteristics of machine learning models include the _model size_, _power consumption_, _speed_ of learning and inference, etc... TBD<br>

Most typical performance limiter is DRAM access bound. Therefore, the general optimization approach is to find a way to reduce the number of DRAM accesses (do more things within registers and within internal memory of a chip).  

Small model size is a key to improving of other performance characteristics of a model [1]:
1. Smaller CNNs require less communication across servers during distributed training.  
2. Smaller CNNs require less bandwidth to export a new model from the
cloud to an autonomous car. 
3. Smaller CNNs are more feasible to deploy on FPGAs and other hardware with limited internal memory. (Fitting the model to internal memory saves tons of energy. Internal memory accesses are few orders of magnitude faster=>faster inference)

The question that we are going to address is __what is the minimal model for a given accuracy level__.
